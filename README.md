# Fuso_subsp_OSCC_prelim
Bulk RNA-seq analysis of OSCC cells exposed to different subspecies of F. nucleatum. Preliminary data for an NIH grant application.

As dissapointing as it may be, this repo is just one script! The reads were processed upstream using trimmomatic, but that's kind of boring so I ommited that shell script. However, the R script here contains all the goodies from my full RNA-seq analysis - from DESEq2 to GSEA! Please enjoy!
